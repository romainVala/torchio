class GridSampler(PatchSampler):
    r"""Extract patches across a whole volume.

    Grid samplers are useful to perform inference using all patches from a
    volume. It is often used with a :class:`~torchio.data.GridAggregator`.

    Args:
        subject: Instance of :class:`~torchio.data.Subject`
            from which patches will be extracted. This argument should only be
            used before instantiating a :class:`~torchio.data.GridAggregator`,
            or to precompute the number of patches that would be generated from
            a subject.
        patch_size: Tuple of integers :math:`(w, h, d)` to generate patches
            of size :math:`w \times h \times d`.
            If a single number :math:`n` is provided,
            :math:`w = h = d = n`.
            This argument is mandatory (it is a keyword argument for backward
            compatibility).
        patch_overlap: Tuple of even integers :math:`(w_o, h_o, d_o)`
            specifying the overlap between patches for dense inference. If a
            single number :math:`n` is provided, :math:`w_o = h_o = d_o = n`.
        padding_mode: Same as :attr:`padding_mode` in
            :class:`~torchio.transforms.Pad`. If ``None``, the volume will not
            be padded before sampling and patches at the border will not be
            cropped by the aggregator.
            Otherwise, the volume will be padded with
            :math:`\left(\frac{w_o}{2}, \frac{h_o}{2}, \frac{d_o}{2} \right)`
            on each side before sampling. If the sampler is passed to a
            :class:`~torchio.data.GridAggregator`, it will crop the output
            to its original size.

    Example::

        >>> import torchio as tio
        >>> sampler = tio.GridSampler(patch_size=88)
        >>> colin = tio.datasets.Colin27()
        >>> for i, patch in enumerate(sampler(colin)):
        ...     patch.t1.save(f'patch_{i}.nii.gz')
        ...
        >>> # To figure out the number of patches beforehand:
        >>> sampler = tio.GridSampler(subject=colin, patch_size=88)
        >>> len(sampler)
        8

        information about patch based sampling. Note that
        :attr:`patch_overlap` is twice :attr:`border` in NiftyNet
