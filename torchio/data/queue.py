class Queue(Dataset):
    r"""Queue used for stochastic patch-based training.

    A training iteration (i.e., forward and backward pass) performed on a
    GPU is usually faster than loading, preprocessing, augmenting, and cropping
    a volume on a CPU.
    Most preprocessing operations could be performed using a GPU,
    but these devices are typically reserved for training the CNN so that batch
    size and input tensor size can be as large as possible.
    Therefore, it is beneficial to prepare (i.e., load, preprocess and augment)
    the volumes using multiprocessing CPU techniques in parallel with the
    forward-backward passes of a training iteration.
    Once a volume is appropriately prepared, it is computationally beneficial to
    sample multiple patches from a volume rather than having to prepare the same
    volume each time a patch needs to be extracted.
    The sampled patches are then stored in a buffer or *queue* until
    the next training iteration, at which point they are loaded onto the GPU
    for inference.
    For this, TorchIO provides the :class:`~torchio.data.Queue` class, which also
    inherits from the PyTorch :class:`~torch.utils.data.Dataset`.
    In this queueing system,
    samplers behave as generators that yield patches from random locations
    in volumes contained in the :class:`~torchio.data.SubjectsDataset`.

    The end of a training epoch is defined as the moment after which patches
    from all subjects have been used for training.
    At the beginning of each training epoch,
    the subjects list in the :class:`~torchio.data.SubjectsDataset` is shuffled,
    as is typically done in machine learning pipelines to increase variance
    of training instances during model optimization.
    A PyTorch loader queries the datasets copied in each process,
    which load and process the volumes in parallel on the CPU.
    A patches list is filled with patches extracted by the sampler,
    and the queue is shuffled once it has reached a specified maximum length so
    that batches are composed of patches from different subjects.
    The internal data loader continues querying the
    :class:`~torchio.data.SubjectsDataset` using multiprocessing.
    The patches list, when emptied, is refilled with new patches.
    A second data loader, external to the queue,
    may be used to collate batches of patches stored in the queue,
    which are passed to the neural network.

    Args:
        subjects_dataset: Instance of :class:`~torchio.data.SubjectsDataset`.
        max_length: Maximum number of patches that can be stored in the queue.
            Using a large number means that the queue needs to be filled less
            often, but more CPU memory is needed to store the patches.
        samples_per_volume: Number of patches to extract from each volume.
            A small number of patches ensures a large variability in the queue,
            but training will be slower.
        sampler: A subclass of :class:`~torchio.data.sampler.PatchSampler` used
            to extract patches from the volumes.
        num_workers: Number of subprocesses to use for data loading
            (as in :class:`torch.utils.data.DataLoader`).
            ``0`` means that the data will be loaded in the main process.
        shuffle_subjects: If ``True``, the subjects dataset is shuffled at the
            beginning of each epoch, i.e. when all patches from all subjects
            have been processed.
        shuffle_patches: If ``True``, patches are shuffled after filling the
            queue.
        start_background: If ``True``, the loader will start working in the
            background as soon as the queue is instantiated.
        verbose: If ``True``, some debugging messages will be printed.

    This diagram represents the connection between
    a :class:`~torchio.data.SubjectsDataset`,
    a :class:`~torchio.data.Queue`
    and the :class:`~torch.utils.data.DataLoader` used to pop batches from the
    queue.

        :alt: Training with patches

    This sketch can be used to experiment and understand how the queue works.
    In this case, :attr:`shuffle_subjects` is ``False``
    and :attr:`shuffle_patches` is ``True``.

    .. note:: :attr:`num_workers` refers to the number of workers used to
        load and transform the volumes. Multiprocessing is not needed to pop
        patches from the queue, so you should always use ``num_workers=0`` for
        the :class:`~torch.utils.data.DataLoader` you instantiate to generate
        training batches.

    Example:

    >>> import torch
    >>> import torchio as tio
    >>> from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
    >>> patch_size = 96
    >>> queue_length = 300
    >>> samples_per_volume = 10
    >>> sampler = tio.data.UniformSampler(patch_size)
    >>> subject = tio.datasets.Colin27()
    >>> subjects_dataset = tio.SubjectsDataset(10 * [subject])
    >>> patches_queue = tio.Queue(
    ...     subjects_dataset,
    ...     queue_length,
    ...     samples_per_volume,
    ...     sampler,
    ...     num_workers=4,
    ... )
    >>> patches_loader = DataLoader(patches_queue, batch_size=16)
    >>> num_epochs = 2
    >>> model = torch.nn.Identity()
    >>> for epoch_index in range(num_epochs):
    ...     for patches_batch in patches_loader:
    ...         inputs = patches_batch['t1'][tio.DATA]  # key 't1' is in subject
    ...         targets = patches_batch['brain'][tio.DATA]  # key 'brain' is in subject
    ...         logits = model(inputs)  # model being an instance of torch.nn.Module
